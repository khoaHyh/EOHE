# README for EOHE
Escape On Hallow's Eve

This game was created as a final project for the CS50: Intro to Computer Science 2020 course.

I drew inspiration from Maplestory, a nostalgic 2D side scrolling MMORPG that I started playing over a decade ago and sometimes revisit. One of the well-known challenges in the game were 'jump quests' which were essentially obstacle courses that required precision in timing and movement to reach a finish point to receive a reward.

In Escape On Hallow's Eve you play as Timmy, a zombie who finds himself stuck in a side scrolling graveyard on Hallow's Eve! To get out, he must reach the sacred tombstone through the "Undead Course" and lift this restraint (which may or may not allow him to explore the world in a sequel?!?). He may also rescue his friends by restarting the Undead Course and completing it (maybe under a minute?) to bring along his two other friends Georgie and Bill.

* **How to run:**
  1. Download the project as a zip file.
  2. Unzip the file onto your computer.
  3. Navigate to the "Play" folder and find the "EOHE.exe" file
  4. Execute the EOHE.exe file to play

* **Objective:** Escape the graveyard by touching the sacred Tombstone!

* **How to play:**
    * Hold down 'Left' and 'Right' arrow keys to move left and right
    * Press 'Spacebar' to jump
    * Press 'h' to toggle character collision box
    * To reset the timer, you must position your character at the wooden sign that points right and press 'q'
    * If you beat the jump quest once, you will unlock 'Georgie'. If you beat the jumpquest under 1 minute you will unlock 'Bill'.
    * Once you have unlocked a skin, you may switch between them by pressing '1', '2', or '3' depending on which skins you have unlocked. Pressing '1' will select the default skin.

If you're proud of your time, you may add a screenshot to the 'fastest-times' folder and send in a pull request to get on the list! Other than that, have fun and feel free to comment any issues.
